# [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/) Code Challenge:

**Overview:** The purpose of this challenge is to test basic iOS skills such as making API calls and creating user interfaces. You’ll need to fetch JSON data from an API and display the contents in a simple TableView or CollectionView. 

**API:** For this challenge you’ll need to fetch data from XKCD's API. Each comic has a number starting with one. The idea is the fetch the comics and display them in chronological order (oldest first). 

**UI:** Display the results in a basic TableView or CollectionView - As the user scrolls more comics should be fetched. You should display the comic title, image, alt text, and date of creation to the user. Sample images are provided below. Don’t worry about getting too fancy with the styling. Additionally, the size of the comic images varies extensively - don’t worry about displaying the images perfectly, just make sure the whole comic is visible.

**Dependencies:** Please include at least one Cocoapod in your project. It can be any dependency that you like to use (ex: Alamofire, KingFisher, SnapKit, etc).

**Bonuses:** 
Allow the user to pinch to zoom in on a comic.
Use MVVM architecture.

**Finished:** When you’ve completed the challenge please provide a link to a Github repo where the project can be downloaded.
